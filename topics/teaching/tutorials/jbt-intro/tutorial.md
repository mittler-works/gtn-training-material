title: An introduction to Jupyter based teaching
subtopic: practises
draft: true
time_estimation: 15m
questions:
  - What are the general advantages and limitations of Jupyter based teaching?
objectives:
  - An overview is provided to familiarize teachers with the advantages and limitations of Jupyter-based teaching.
key_points:
  - Jupyter-based teaching offers an easy entrypoint for students, but deprives them of the need to learn basic setup steps themselves.

# Jupyter Terminology

In the context of Jupyter, there are some components with similar terminology involved. It is important to know how to keep them apart, which is why this tutorial begins with a list of common Jupyter wording.

### Jupyter
is the name of the umbrella open source project that provides Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, JupyterHub and many more projects.

### Jupyter Notebook
is a computer program that serves a webbased interactive tool for writing, documenting, and sharing code. Please note, that the `.ipnb` document itself is often reffered to as the Jupyter Notebook. Please always mind the context to distinguish between the Jupyter Notebook program and the Jupyter Notebook document.

### JupyterLab
is a computer program that serves an extensible webbased environment for interactive coding, that combines Jupyter Notebook with other components like text editors, terminals, kernels, plots and more.

### JupyterHub
is a centralized organizational platform for JupyterLab on a server. It allows to provide many users with JupyterLab instances and handles authentication and authorization.


# Advantages for teaching

* User management

* Integratable with LMS (Moodle etc)

* Interactive teaching

* Code, Data, Documentation, Results --> All in one place

* Customizable for your course needs

* Predefined Environment

* Web-based, BYD --> No onboarding time, instant teaching, Easy to use

* Localization

* Reproducability

# Disadvantages for teaching

* Important first steps are not need to be taught

* Bad Code Practices can easily creep in

* Less debugging possibilities

* Dependecies

* Habituation effects

* Jail effects
